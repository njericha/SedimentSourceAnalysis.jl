## Summary of Features
- Import grain data from Excel files
- Perform kernel density estimation on grain data by sinks and features
- Decompose sink distributions into weighted combination of sources
- Label grains based on learned sources
- Plot kernel densities, sink, and source distributions

## Repo organization

Our main numerical experiment can be found in `knownsources median bandwidth.jl` under the `examples` folder.

The data used in our main numerical experiment `knownsources median bandwidth.jl` can be found [here](https://github.com/njericha/SedimentSourceAnalysis.jl/tree/main/data/sundell2022) under `data/sundell2022`. The exact grains selected and number of grains from each sink can be found in `data/20sinks from 3Sources from Sundell et al 2022.xlsx`.

The data handling and backend functions can be found in `src/SedimentTools`.

Our main decomposition algorithm can be found in the more general repo [BlockTensorDecomposition.jl](https://github.com/MPF-Optimization-Laboratory/BlockTensorDecomposition.jl).


## How to run the code

### In Browser
1. Go to https://github.com/njericha/SedimentSourceAnalysis.jl
2. Click "<> Code" and press "+" to "Create a codespace on main". It make take a few moments to set up.
3. Open the command palett with `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
4. Enter `>Julia: Start REPL`
5. In the REPL, resolve any dependency issues with `pkg> resolve` and `pkg> instantiate` (use `julia> ]` to get to the package manager). It may take a few minutes to download dependencies.

Run one of the example files by opening the file and pressing the triangular "run" button, or `>Julia: Execute active File in REPL`.

**OR**
### On your own device
1. Clone the repo at https://github.com/njericha/SedimentSourceAnalysis.jl
2. Navigate to the root of the repository in a terminal and run `julia`
3. Activate the project with `pkg> activate .` (use `julia> ]` to get to the package manager)
4. resolve any dependency issues with `pkg> resolve`

### Importing the package
Type `julia> using SedimentSourceAnalysis` load the package, or `using SedimentSourceAnalysis.SedimentTools` to load the submodule directly.

## Examples
See the `examples` folder for the following files.

`knownsources median bandwidth.jl`: Uses data from Sundel et al where we know the sources of each Grain. Use this to see how well the factorization performs with realistic data.

`knownsources.jl`: Similar to `knownsources median bandwidth.jl`, but uses the bandwidth from the first sink.

`measurementcorrelation.jl`: Checks the validity of representing the grain distributions as a product distribution. In particular, we would like the measurements to be independent.

`unknownsources.jl`: Uses data from Lee et al where we don't have a ground truth. Showcases how the method would be used in practice.

`randomtensor.jl`: Factorizes a random 50x50x50 tensor. See how the factorization performs in theory when a perfect factorization exists.

## Submodules
The main submodule of this repo is SedimentTools. The submodule MTF has been moved to a separate repo [BlockTensorDecomposition](https://github.com/MPF-Optimization-Laboratory/BlockTensorDecomposition.jl).

### SedimentTools
Holds various types at the [`Grain`], and [`Sink`] level, importing ([`read_raw_data`]) and processing data ([`make_densities`]) functions, and additional methods of some [Plots.jl](https://docs.juliaplots.org/stable/) functions for visualization with these custom types.

### BlockTensorDecomposition
Defines the main factorization function [`nnmtf`](@ref) and related mathematical functions. See the repo here [BlockTensorDecomposition.jl](https://github.com/MPF-Optimization-Laboratory/BlockTensorDecomposition.jl).
